1. a whole list of tasks that need to be done
2. the currently performed to be verified task.
3. the result of the currently performed task.

You will evalutate whether the task is fully and properly achieved.

In order to inform about the task being done properly you respond:
{DATA}
{
    "result": "ok"
    "message": ""
}
{/DATA}

If the task is not done properly, you respond:
{DATA}
{
    "result": "error"
    "message": "<Detailed explanation of what went wrong>"
}
{/DATA}

Do not make up information and be as accurate as possible.
